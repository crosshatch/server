# Crosshatch

> Personalized Stories for Every Child's Journey.

Crosshatch is a tool for parents and educators to create engaging, adaptive stories that enrich
educational experiences and foster personal growth.

## Preface

Stories ignite curiosity and help children explore passions and new worlds, both real and
fantastical. Yet, many stories fail to address each child's unique needs, limiting their
developmental potential.

## Problem Statement

1. Parents and educators struggle to find or create stories tailored to children's developmental
   needs. This presents a missed opportunity to integrate curriculum topics, engaging themes, and
   guided support through key stages of growth.
2. Children are particularly susceptible to low-value media, which often prioritizes entertainment
   value over cognitive development.
3. Storytelling devices lack mechanisms for measuring their impact on and adapting to the reader.
   Without this feedback loop, parents and educators are left in the dark, unable to assess how
   effectively stories resonate with kids or support developmental goals. This makes it difficult to
   refine narratives, tailor content to individual needs, and maximize educational or emotional
   outcomes.

## Solution

Admins, such as parents and teachers, visit crosshatch.land and input context for story generation.
This context can include the desired style of writing and illustrations, story subject matter,
morals and themes, and even uploaded documents and lesson plans. Admins can also enable modes of
interactivity, which can engage readers with quizzes, outcome-bearing choice prompts, character
dialogues and other elements.

- A math teacher might create a story where students embark on a vivid adventure through Middle
  Earth, solving math equations to advance the quest.
- A parent might create a story to help their child cope with the emotional challenges of having a
  new sibling; the generated story could reframe the experience positively and highlight the joys of
  family.

In both cases, **the admin helps the child internalize the intended message by fostering a strong
connection to the story and its characters.**

Crosshatch also provides insights, allowing admins to track key metrics relating to progress in
areas like reading comprehension and problem-solving. Crosshatch meets the growing demand for
educational content that engages children while empowering parents and educators.

## Market

The US education technology (EdTech) market has experienced significant growth in recent years. In
2023, the market was valued at approximately $42.34 billion and is projected to reach $90.61 billion
by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2024 to 2030.[^1]

Other key metrics:

- There are 1.8 billion children globally under 15 years of age.[^2]
- As of 2022, there were 23.2 million families in the US with children under 12 years of age.[^3]
- Parents spend an average of $586 per child annually on educational tools.[^4]

Market data suggests that parents increasingly seek screen time with purpose, preferring apps that
provide educational value and foster creativity. Crosshatch addresses this growing demand.

## Revenue Model

- Attract users with free limited access and convert them into paid users.
- Users purchase packs of tokens. For $4.99, a user can purchase 5 million tokens.
  > Each token corresponds to approximately three letters generated by the underlying model. For
  > example, generating the text "the quick brown fox" would consume four tokens.
- Offer custom packages for large organizations such as schools.

Crosshatch aims to be the primary platform with which parents and educators create engaging content
for children and track progress. Every generation incurs token usage, which directly corresponds to
revenue.

## Strategy

### Go-to-Market Strategy

1. Conduct a pilot program with a select group of parents, the children of which are between the
   ages of 5 and 7.
2. Establish a robust user feedback pipeline.
3. Launch an MVP with core story generation features.
4. Add educational tools that enable educators to align story generation with curriculum standards.
5. Add basic interactivity to enable the interspersing of creative exercises, homework, examinations
   and side-quests.
6. Work with educational organizations to progressively refine the experience for both teachers and
   students. Deeply integrate Crosshatch into the classroom setting.

### Expanding Product Definition

1. Allow generated knowledge and rules to transfer across story boundaries, enabling richer,
   interconnected narratives.
2. Enable connections between users' story worlds. Focus on fostering collaboration.
3. Expand into higher age groups and facilitate specialized kinds of learning.
4. Create a public API, with which admins can authorize 3rd parties to integrate with user story
   worlds. This will enable virtual reality application to integrate with Crosshatch.

### Competitive Advantages

- **Personalized Learning at Scale:** Crosshatch retains learning preferences, character background,
  goals and past story interactions to generate deeply tailored, narratively-cohesive content over
  time.
- **Curriculum Alignment:** Stories can be customized to meet national and regional curriculum
  standards, making integration into diverse educational settings seamless.
- **Admin Oversight:** Parents and educators participate in the process of defining the trajectory
  of the story.
- **Unmatched Quality Through Fine-Tuning:** Within just a few sessions, Crosshatch fine-tunes
  child-specific models to deliver highly-personalized stories that far surpass generic
  alternatives. This effect compounds over time.
- **AI-Driven Adaptability:** Built from the ground up with AI, Crosshatch dynamically evolves to
  meet changing learning goals and preferences, ensuring long-term relevance and engagement.

### Funding Strategy

Crosshatch is currently built by a single contributor and does not require funding. However, there
will come a time when it is necessary to hire employees, retain legal council and pay for security
audits and advertising, among many other expenses. When this time comes, the business can
participate in programs designed to support innovation in the EdTech sector. One such example is
**Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)**; this program consists of several federal agencies
(including the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation) which offer funding to
EdTech innovators.

### Addressing Regulatory and Ethical Concerns

While the intended end consumer of Crosshatch is children, the immediate customer is parents and
educators, who are equipped to discern how the end experience takes shape. Admin oversight is a core
tenet of the platform; admins are responsible for approving generated content (and therefore
removing any biases or undesirable content).

Crosshatch complies with child data privacy regulations (e.g., COPPA, GDPR) and has undergone
numerous security audits.

## Conclusion

Crosshatch sits at the intersection of four rapidly expanding markets: personalized entertainment,
EdTech, creative tools and artificial intelligence. By addressing key pain points with a tailored
solution, Crosshatch is poised to capture a loyal user base, drive sustainable revenue, and expand
into emerging markets like AR/VR and next-generation AI, which will transform how we model and
refine human cognition.

As we move towards this future, Crosshatch will empower families and educators to harness the
transformative power of storytelling to unlock curiosity, creativity, and growth. By bridging
education and imagination, Crosshatch equips the next generation with the skills and mindset to
shape the future with confidence and purpose.
