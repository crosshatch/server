> Personalized, Interactive Stories for Every Child's Journey.

Crosshatch is a tool for parents and educators to create engaging, adaptive stories that enrich
education experiences and foster personal growth.

## Preface

Stories ignite curiosity and growth, helping children explore passions and the world. Yet, many
stories fail to address each child's unique needs, limiting their developmental potential.

## Problem Statement

1. Parents and educators struggle to find or create stories tailored to children's developmental
   needs, missing opportunities to integrate curriculum topics, engaging themes, and guided support
   through key stages of growth. This leaves children vulnerable to low-value media, which can crowd
   out meaningful, educational experiences.
2. Storytelling devices lack mechanisms for measuring their impact on and adapting to the reader.
   Without this feedback loop, parents and educators are left in the dark, unable to assess how
   effectively stories resonate with kids or support developmental goals. This makes it difficult to
   refine narratives, tailor content to individual needs, and maximize educational or emotional
   outcomes.

## Solution

Admins, such as parents and teachers, define the context for story generation, including style,
subject, theme, or lesson plan. Admins can also enable the generation of interactive passages, which
can engage readers with quizzes, character dialogues and other elements. For instance, a math
teacher might create a story where students embark on a vivid adventure through Middle Earth,
solving math equations to advance the quest. This approach to teaching extends beyond just the
classroom. For example, a parent might create a bedtime story to help their child cope with the
emotional challenges of having a new sibling, reframing the experience positively and highlighting
the long-term joys of family. In both cases, the admin helps the child internalize the intended
message by fostering a strong connection to the story and its characters.

Crosshatch also provides real-time insights, allowing admins to track progress in areas like reading
comprehension, problem-solving and emotional health. Crosshatch meets the growing demand for
educational content that engages children while empowering parents and educators.

## Market

Crosshatch taps into the U.S.' $5 billion EdTech market. Meanwhile, the global children's app market
is projected to grow to $14.6 billion by 2026. This growth rate outpaces the overall app market,
reflecting rising demand for specialized educational solutions.

Other key metrics:

- There are 1.9 billion children globally under 15 years of age.
- There are 33 million families in the U.S. with children under 12 years of age.
- Parents spend an average of $1,000 per child annually on educational tools.

Market data suggests that parents increasingly seek screen time with purpose, preferring apps that
provide educational value and foster creativity. Crosshatch addresses this growing demand.

## Revenue Model

- Attract users with free limited access and convert them into paid users.
- Users purchase packs of tokens. For $4.99, a user can purchase 5 million tokens.
  > Each token corresponds to approximately 3 letters generated by the underlying model.
- Offer custom packages for large organizations such as schools.

Crosshatch aims to be the primary platform with which parents and educators create engaging content
for children and track progress. Every generation incurs token usage, which directly corresponds to
revenue.

An additional avenue to be explored is the creation of a content marketplace where authors and
illustrators could whitelist their creations for training purposes. Users could then pay for
licenses of the styles of those content creators. This kind of revenue-sharing is likely in the
long-term, yet tenuous in the near-term, as creative industries resist the onslaught of a creative
paradigm shift. This common good use case––child development models––may help us to overcome the
creative community's defensiveness and establish an AI licensing platform (initially scoped to
children's books).

## Strategy

### Product Strategy

1. Conduct a pilot program with a select group of parents, the children of which are between the
   ages of 5 and 7.
2. Establish a robust user feedback pipeline.
3. Launch an MVP with core story generation features.
4. Add educational tools that enable educators to align story generation with curriculum standards.
5. Add basic interactivity to enable the interspersing of creative exercises, homework, examinations
   and side-quests.
6. Allow generated knowledge and rules to transfer across story boundaries, enabling richer,
   interconnected narratives.
7. Enable connections between users' story worlds. Focus on fostering collaboration.
8. Expand into higher age groups and facilitate specialized kinds of learning.
9. Keep students engaged and evolve their story worlds into adulthood. Integrate their story worlds
   into virtual reality.

### Funding Strategy

Crosshatch is currently built by a single contributor and does not require funding. However, there
will come a point when it is necessary to higher employees, retain legal council and pay for
security audits and advertising, among many other expenses. When this time comes, the business can
participate in programs designed to support innovation in the EdTech sector.

-. **Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)** consists of several federal agencies (including the
Department of Education and the National Science Foundation) which offer funding to EdTech
innovators. -. **America COMPETES Act** aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness through investments in
science and technology.

### Competitive Advantages

- **Personalized Learning at Scale:** Crosshatch retains learning preferences, character background,
  goals and past story interactions to generate deeply tailored, narratively-cohesive content over
  time.
- **Curriculum Alignment:** Stories can be customized to meet national and regional curriculum
  standards, making integration into diverse educational settings seamless.
- **Unmatched Quality Through Fine-Tuning:** With just a few days of usage, Crosshatch fine-tunes
  its models to deliver highly-personalized stories (lessons) that far surpass generic alternatives.
  Over time, this compounding effect creates a personalized planner so effective that it is
  indispensable.
- **AI-Driven Adaptability:** Built from the ground up with AI, Crosshatch dynamically evolves to
  meet changing learning goals and preferences, ensuring long-term relevance and engagement.

## Conclusion

Crosshatch sits at the intersection of four rapidly expanding markets: personalized entertainment,
EdTech, creative tools and artificial intelligence. By addressing key pain points with a tailored
solution, Crosshatch is poised to capture a loyal user base, drive sustainable revenue, and expand
into emerging markets like AR/VR and next-generation AI, which will transform how we model and
refine human cognition.

As we move towards this future, Crosshatch will empower families and educators to harness the
transformative power of storytelling to unlock curiosity, creativity, and growth. By bridging
education and imagination, Crosshatch equips the next generation with the skills and mindset to
shape the future with confidence and purpose.
